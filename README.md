# Tip Calculator 

## Lorenzo Ahn

**Tip Calculator** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount 
owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on).
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected.
* [x] The user is able to split the bill among x number of people.

## Notes

As my first Android development project, it was an interesting challenge getting used to the interactions between the code and design views as it is a unique dynamic relative to other programming languages I've worked with. One implementation that I found particularly challenging was implementing the tip splitting function. Firstly, it was challenging since it is a function that I implemented withouth any guidance. Secondly, it was challenging because I had to use all the skills I had learned so far to make this new function intuitive and clean. Thirdly, it was challenging to design around edge cases, such as when the split amount is < 0 or empty. I chose to pursue this extension because I noticed that most of the time I go out to eat, I end up eating with friends, making splitting tabs a necessity.
